## Problem 1

In this function, random birthdays can be created and tell if there are duplicated ones. 

```{r}
set.seed(1)

birthday_dup = function(n_people, n_days = 365) {
  birthdays = sample(1:n_days, size = n_people, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}

```

Now, stimulate 10,000 times for sample size 2~50 and calculate the probability of occurring duplicated birthdays. Results are stored in sim_results_df. 

```{r}

sim_results_df = 
  expand_grid(
    group_size = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    dup = map_lgl(group_size, birthday_dup)
  ) |> 
  group_by(group_size) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_dup = mean(dup)
  )
```


```{r}

```
